      <description>Good forecasts can seem almost magical, while bad forecasts may be dangerous. We can look at three famous predictions about computing:
 I think there is a world market for maybe five computers. (Chairman of IBM, 1943) Computers in the future may weigh no more than 1.5 tons.

      <description>The goal of this post and series is to present the foundational concept, usability, intuition of the algorithmic part and some basic axamples of Hidden Markov Models. To understand the content, basic knowledge on probability should be sufficient.
Why kind of problems I can solve with them? The ones where we observe a sequential data but we suspect that behind the scenes there may be something going on that affects the sequence we are looking at.</description>
